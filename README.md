This repository contains the implementation for Project SkyLogic , which integrates a frozen vision encoder with a frozen GPT-OSS LLM. By training only a lightweight projection layer, the system efficiently aligns visual features from ISRO satellite data with text embeddings to produce conversational reports.
# SkyLogic: Vision-Enhanced GPT for ISRO EO Data Analysis

**SkyLogic** is a project for the Smart India Hackathon 2025 (Problem Statement ID: 25170) that enhances OpenAI's GPT-OSS with multimodal vision capabilities specifically for ISRO Earth Observation (EO) data.

The core of our solution is a **lightweight projection layer** that aligns outputs from a vision encoder with the text embedding space of a frozen GPT-OSS model.This approach significantly reduces training complexity and computational costs while preserving the powerful text reasoning capabilities of the large language model (LLM).


## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Efficient Training**: Keeps the vision encoder and LLM frozen, only training the lightweight projection layer, which saves 20-65x in compute costs.
* **ISRO Data Focused**: Tailored to process and interpret ISRO's Level-1 and Level-2 satellite products.
* **Natural Language Insights**: Transforms complex satellite imagery into human-readable explanations for tasks like land cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring.
* **Accessible AI**: Makes complex geospatial data analysis accessible to non-experts through conversational Q&A and automated reports.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

The model uses a two-stage training process:
1.  **Alignment**: First, align general image-caption pairs to teach the projection layer the relationship between visual and textual concepts.
2.  **Fine-Tuning**: Then, fine-tune the model on specific ISRO EO datasets to specialize its capabilities for land cover analysis, change detection, and environmental monitoring.
